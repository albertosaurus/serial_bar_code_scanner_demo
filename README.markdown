# Serial Port Scanner Demo

This is the demo Ruby on Rails application running on [Torquebox](http://www.torquebox.org) that shows how to push messages from a Honeywell bar code scanner configured to run as a serial device.
Note that it has only been tested with a Vuquest 3310g.

## How to install

1. Read the slides
2. Install Java 1.7 and JRuby
3. Plug in your scanner. Note, that it needs to be configured to run as a serial device. On OS X, it should show up as something like `/dev/tty.usbmodem1421`. On Linux, it'll be something like `/dev/usbACM0`.
4. Pull down the repository. Then run the following:

```
bundle install
torquebox deploy
torquebox run
```

You can now point your browser to http://localhost:8080
